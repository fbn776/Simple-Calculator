# Simple-Calculator
A simple calculator application for android.
This is a demo application. Has some issues with it.

### Issue
The there is an issue with `-` symbol. The application treats every operator as a binary operator.
But the `-` can also be used as a negation operator, which is a unary operator. This is not fixed :(
